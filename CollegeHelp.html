      <p id="description">
        My name is Demetrious Lloyd and, apart from being an aspiring web developer, I am also a recent graduate of UC Santa Barbara Class of 2018. I faced many challenges acquiring my degree and wished to create a resource for future students. I am a first generation college graduate with a B.S. in Chemistry, Minor in Applied Psychology.
        Websites linked below may be limited in scope, so I hope to expand as I recieve more input. Let's get you learning!
      </p>
      <h3>Free Textbooks</h3>
        <p>LibreTexts<sup>TM</sup> provides free online textbooks for many subject areas. Unless you are assigned homework from one sepcific textbook, you often only need information on the subject you are learning. Using these resources saves money spent on expensive books and allows for study anywhere with internet access.</p>
        <p>Once on the homepage select the dropdown menu and click "Explore the Libraries"</p>
        <h4>LibreTexts<sup>TM</sup> Subjects</h4>
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: square;"> <a href=https://libretexts.org id=textbook target="_blank">LibreTexts<sup>TM</sup> Link</a></li>
          <br>
          <li>Biology</li>
          <li>Business</li>
          <li>Chemistry</li>

    <h3>Open Courseware</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" id="opencourseware" target="_blank">MIT Open Courseware</a></li>
          <li> <a href="http://ocw.uci.edu/" id="opencourseware" target="_blank">UC Irvine Open Courseware</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many universities have FREE pre-recorded video lectures, PowerPoints, and notes from courses you are currently taking. Finding them is as simple as searching the term "Open Courseware". Doing some searching around these websites may allow you to find alternate versions of courses in case you miss a lecture, have a schedule conflict, or just don't understand your lecturer. Never forget to search for open courseware on other sources like YouTube and Social Media.
        </p>

      <h3>Calculus/Math</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/" id="math" target="_blank">Paul's Notes</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math" id="math" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a></li>
        <li>Open Courseware</li>
      </ul>
        <p>These are the resources I used to pass my math courses at UC Santa Barbara. Since I wanted a Bachelors of Science, I started with differential calculus. Knowing that not everyone will begin at this level, I included Khan Academy's generic math website. It covers lower division calculus for a STEM major (including differential equations and multivariable calculus) in addition to less intensive subjects like algebra and statistics.</p>
<hr>
      <h3>Chemistry</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry" id="chem" target="_blank">Khan Academy: General Chemistry</a></li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry" id="chem" target="_blank">Khan Academy: Organic Chemistry</a></li>
          <li> <a href="http://ocw.uci.edu/courses/" id="chem" target="_blank">UCI Open Courseware</a></li>
          <li> <a href="http://symmetry.otterbein.edu/gallery/index.html" id="chem" target="_blank">Point Group Visuals</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since I majored in chemistry, this information may be slightly more selective and repetitive than the other categories. I found that Khan Academy worked great for General and Organic Chemistry, while UC Irvine Open Courseware and LibreTexts<sup>TM</sup> helped for upper division courses. At the end of the day, nothing beats sitting down and working with your peers to solve problems.
          Plagiarism is wrong and unethical, but many assignments in the work world are solved with teamwork and collective knowledge. Use your friends and do not be afraid to ask for help.

      <h3>Khan Academy</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org" id="khan"target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> has been brought up multiple times. It is a great resource for STEM and non-STEM students alike. A quick search around the website reveals the plethora of courses available. History, test preparation (LSAT, MCAT), physics and personal finances are but a few of the various topics. I personally attest to the site's ability to teach math, chemistry and US history.</p>

  <h3>Computer Coding</h3>
    <h4>Free Websites for Learning to Code</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" id="coding" target="_blank">SoloLearn</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" id="coding" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" id="coding" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming" id="coding" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a></li>
        <li>Open Courseware</li>
      </ul>
      <p> One of my mentors in university told me "if you're 20 years old and don't know how to code you will have trouble getting a job in this era".
        I have only recently started coding, but it definitely helps with calculations and working in research laboratories.

      <h3>Foreign Language</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" id= "language" target="_blank">Duolingo</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.babbel.com/" id= "language" target="_blank">Babbel</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.pimsleur.com/" id= "language" target="_blank">Pimsleur Approach</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Having visited over five countries across three continents, I can attest to the importance of learning another language. Sometimes it is a high school requirement, a personal goal, or a temporary necessity. Here are some resources to learn various languages.
          <br>
          Please Note: Pimsleur Approach is quite pricy, but it is very effective for learning how to have a conversation and it has the widest variety of languages I have found. If you cannot find a friend to practice with and are leaving the country for a long period, I highly recommend it. Fair Warning: Each lesson is about 30 minutes, but you have to practice EVERY DAY.

      <h3>Career and Professional Development</h3>
        <p>Whether you are seeking a part-time job to pay for college or recently recieved a degree and are looking for work, it is important to network and develop a professional online presence. Below are some links to help you get started.</p>
        <h4>LinkedIn</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Growing up the population's social media website of choice was Myspace, then it became Facebook, this was followed by Twitter. LinkedIn is a social media website for professional development and networking. It can be used to find jobs and connect with people you have worked with. These days LinkedIn has become a necessity in the professional realm. Make a page with a professional photo and take your page very seriously. What you post online stays there forever.</p>
        <h4>Job Seeking</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.indeed.com/" target="_blank">Indeed.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com" target="_blank">ZipRecruiter</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are websites that help for looking at jobs in your area. Applying to jobs online is necessary and often easier, but it will never beat networking. It is not what you know, it is who you know. Send representatives at your prospective companies an inquiry email or try and schedule an informational interview.</p>
        <h4>Mobile Banking</h4>
          <p>Nowadays many people have smartphones. Downloading your bank's mobile app allows you keep track of purchases immediately after you make them. Additionally, you can keep track of your credit card debt to ensure payments are made on time. This can prevent fraud, improve credit scores and assist in creating a money management plan.</p>
        <h4>Bureau of Labor Statistics</h4>
          <p>
          <a href="https://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
          <br>
          Researching the job you want is as important. You study for exams, so why not study for your life? The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor has on its website, an extensive list of careers held by Americans. It provides data such as average salary and job projections by career.
            It also narrows down the information by state and county. Search different jobs you might be interested in and play around with the site's data tools.
